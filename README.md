# Maze-representation

This program can create a maze by a matrix that you give and analyze the various characteristics of this maze, such as the numbers of accessible areas and inaccessible inner points.

(This program was a course project of PRINCIPLES OF PROGRAMMING in 2019 T3. The code is a bit messy. But I don't want to refactor it.)
